npm init -y
npm run serve 

These will allow you to run the project at home. 

This project is a site that I created after the Keurig page. 

It follows the mvc model and uses webpack in order to load content!

Just a heads up, I was unable to get the firebase working. I had an error with it that I have never seen before.
